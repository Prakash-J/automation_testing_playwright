## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

**Automation Testing Framework for AutomationExercise.com**

This project is a scalable, modular, and industry-standard automation testing framework built using [Microsoft Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to perform end-to-end testing on [automationexercise.com](https://automationexercise.com), a web application designed for automation practice. The framework validates critical user journeys such as login, signup, product search, cart operations, and checkout workflows across multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).

The primary goals of this project are to:

- âœ… Demonstrate best practices in modern test automation using Playwright
- âœ… Build a clean and maintainable testing architecture with TypeScript
- âœ… Support cross-browser and cross-platform execution
- âœ… Enable CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions
- âœ… Provide detailed test reports and failure diagnostics via screenshots, videos, and traces
